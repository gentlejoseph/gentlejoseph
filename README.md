# Hi, I'm Gentle 👋

<strong>I am a Front-end Engineer.</strong>

Currently, I am a software engineer at Cashrewards. I've spent the last ~7 years as a frontend-developer where I specialize
in transforming beautiful designs into full-fledged interactive webapps/websites for various clients all around the world.

I'm always trying new tools and frameworks to keep up with the latest trends. Typically I'll be digging in with Angular, React/NextJs or architecting CSS in and out of JavaScript.
Recently, Framer Motion, Tailwind, and Storybook have been added into the mix.

When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'll find me gaming, gardening, watching/playing cricket or walking around with my camera.
