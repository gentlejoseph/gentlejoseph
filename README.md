# Hi there, I'm Gentle 👋

<strong>A passionate Front-end Engineer from Brisbane, Australia</strong>

I am currently a senior software engineer at Cashrewards with over 8 years of frontend development experience. My journey has led me to collaborate with clients from around the world, transforming their visions into engaging and interactive web applications.

I'm always trying new tools and frameworks to keep up with the latest trends. Typically I'll be digging in with Angular, React/NextJs or architecting CSS in and out of JavaScript.
Recently, Framer Motion, Tailwind, and Storybook have been added to the mix.

When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'll find me gaming, gardening, watching/playing cricket or walking around with my camera.
